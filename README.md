# Geekly Media Shop E-Commerce

Welcome to this amazing app built using TypeScript, React, Express and SQLite.

## Steps to run locally
- First of all, make sure to have the following:
  - Node.js > 18
  - .env files created in both client and server folders (following the .env.examples). I'm sharing my sandbox API so you can use Paypal functionality.

- Located on the root of the app, run in Terminal `npm run dev`. This command will immediately run client and server and will create a database with some migration seeds. You can go to http://localhost:5173 and see the magic.

## Seeds
- 6 products with all their information.
- 2 users:
  - email: geekly_admin@email.com password: Test1234*
  - User: geekly_user@email.com password: Test1234*

## Paypal
You can use my Paypal sandbox personal credentials to run mock payments using the real Paypal API.
